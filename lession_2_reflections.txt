What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- A Hidden Folder .git is created that stores the commits (the repository)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area collects all the files for a commit. It is a good way to only commit the files that are important
